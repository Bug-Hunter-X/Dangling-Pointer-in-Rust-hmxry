This repository contains a simple example of a common error in Rust: creating a dangling pointer.  The `bug.rs` file demonstrates the problematic code. The solution, found in `bugSolution.rs`, addresses the issue.  The core problem is manipulating memory after the underlying data structure is no longer valid. The solution highlights safer ways to manage memory to avoid this issue.
